## [Link to interactive illustration on GeoGebra:](https://www.geogebra.org/m/wnataapv "Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, final")

Illustration of eigenvectors of the transformation T(x) = Ax, where vectors u and v are
eigenvectors and w not an eigenvector but rather demonstrated to show the difference. vector u and its
transformation along line 𝒚 = −𝒙, vector v and its transformation along line 𝒚 = 𝟎
